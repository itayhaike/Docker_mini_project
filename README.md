# Docker_mini_project
Config files for my GitHub profile.

!!!!!THE PROJECT NEED TO RUN ON JENKINS!!!!
Write a Dockerfile that creates a new container based on Alpine Linux and call it 
AlpCon. 
Build a script that checks if AlpCon is running, if the container is not running start 
it. This script will do the following operations on the container: 
1. Download a python file from a git repository. 
2. Runs the python program which writes the result to a simple text file in the 
public directory. 
3. Waits for 10 seconds.. if the python file is still running, kill it and print failed 
test. 
4. Stop the container. 
Your project needs to be as minimal as possible without any unnecessary 
additions.
